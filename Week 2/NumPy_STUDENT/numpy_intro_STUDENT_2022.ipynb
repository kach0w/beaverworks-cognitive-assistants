    "# What is NumPy Good For?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've done quite a bit looking at how NumPy can be used to work with numbers. But we really want to do computer vision and NLP, which involve images and words, right? It isn't necessarily clear how these tasks can be translated into numbers, so how is NumPy at all useful for machine learning work in these areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is that **observed data are just numbers**. Consider the image of a cat below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"cat_pixels.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This picture is stored on the computer as a rectangular array (with shape 594 x 580) of numbers. Each number tells the computer how bright it should make the corresponding pixel on the screen in order to render the image accurately; the larger the number, the brighter the pixel. In the case of a colored image, each pixel consists of three numbers instead of one, and they tell each pixel how much red, green, and blue color should be present in the pixel, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus doing mathematical analysis and manipulations on an image might be simpler than we would have assumed, were we to think of the picture as some impenetrable “image-format file” on our computer. When handed a png, we can easily load that image as a NumPy array and proceed from there with our analysis. While we might not yet know precisely what our mathematical approach will be to gleaning useful information from the image, we certainly are no longer in unfamiliar territory – we can definitely do “mathy” stuff to an array of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with text doesn’t give us quite as clean of a story as does imagery — there is no text equivalent to a pixel. Rather, a major challenge in the field of natural language processing is establishing a cogent numerical representation for text. We will discuss this matter in some considerable depth in subsequent weeks, but rest assured, we will devise ways of representing text as numbers, with which we can do \"mathy\" things to model our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway here is: no matter how exotic a machine learning problem may appear to be, we will always find a way to map our observations to numbers that we can do math on. This true for jpegs, videos, pdfs, “tweets”, audio recordings, etc."
