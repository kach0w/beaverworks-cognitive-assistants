    "We will begin by ascribing words numerical representations based solely on the contexts in which they occur; that is, we will represent words based on the words that commonly occur around them. \n",

    "For example, the sentences \"dogs are loud pets\" and \"cats are quiet pets\" not only draw similarities and distinctions between cats and dogs, but these sentences also begin to convey some meaning for the word \"pet\". By tracking the words that commonly occur in the midst of \"pet\" across many documents, we hope to arrive at a coherent numerical representation of \"pet\" that is able encode that the words \"cat\", \"dog\", \"parakeet\", \"owner\", \"care\", \"train\" are all relevant to the concept of \"pet\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, we will need to define what we mean by \"context\", and define a window size that we use when \"scanning\" our text. \n",

    "Each row of the context matrix corresponds to a unique word in our corpus; we will update that word's row when it occurs in the center of a context window.\n",

    "> for all appearances of word $i$ in the center of the context window, word $j$ had $X_{i,j}$ number of co-occurences with $i$ ($j$ appeared $x$ number of times within the specified context window around word $i$)\n",

To make it feasible to train our model, we will also restrict the number words that we consider context words to the most frequent `max_context_words` words. Note that this `max_context_words` restriction is not the same as reducing the length of our context window: we are actually limiting the vocabulary size of context words to the most common `max_context_words` words in the full vocabulary."
