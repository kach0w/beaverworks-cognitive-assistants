    "We will begin by ascribing words numerical representations based solely on the contexts in which they occur; that is, we will represent words based on the words that commonly occur around them. \n",

    "For example, the sentences \"dogs are loud pets\" and \"cats are quiet pets\" not only draw similarities and distinctions between cats and dogs, but these sentences also begin to convey some meaning for the word \"pet\". By tracking the words that commonly occur in the midst of \"pet\" across many documents, we hope to arrive at a coherent numerical representation of \"pet\" that is able encode that the words \"cat\", \"dog\", \"parakeet\", \"owner\", \"care\", \"train\" are all relevant to the concept of \"pet\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, we will need to define what we mean by \"context\", and define a window size that we use when \"scanning\" our text. \n",

    "Each row of the context matrix corresponds to a unique word in our corpus; we will update that word's row when it occurs in the center of a context window.\n",
    "For a given row, the values of the content matrix are the tallies of the appearances of other words within the context window (the number of co-occurences of context words).  So, if $X_{i,j}$ is the value of element $(i,j)$, our context matrix can be interpreted as:\n",
    "> for all appearances of word $i$ in the center of the context window, word $j$ had $X_{i,j}$ number of co-occurences with $i$ ($j$ appeared $x$ number of times within the specified context window around word $i$)\n",

    "Because this matrix can grow very large as the vocabulary size grows, we will restrict the size of the vocabulary to the most frequent `max_vocab_words` words (again removing the common \"glue\" words that help make language interpretable, but not meaningful). To make it feasible to train our model, we will also restrict the number words that we consider context words to the most frequent `max_context_words` words. Note that this `max_context_words` restriction is not the same as reducing the length of our context window: we are actually limiting the vocabulary size of context words to the most common `max_context_words` words in the full vocabulary."
